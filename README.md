  # TASK_3
  This notebook covers essential Python control flow tools used in decision-making and iteration. Each section is designed with clear examples and explanations to help learners understand the logic and usage of different flow-control statements.

Section 1: Conditional Statements if Statement if-else Statement if-elif-else Statement

Section 2: for Loop Iterating through lists, strings, and ranges

Section 3: while Loop Looping based on condition Infinite loop handling

Section 4: Control Statements break: Exit the loop early continue: Skip current iteration pass: Placeholder for future code
